# Titanic Data Analysis
This data analysis project aims to explore the Titanic dataset using Python and various data analysis libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. The dataset contains information about passengers on the ill-fated Titanic, including details about their age, gender, class, survival status, and more. In this analysis, we will uncover insights, answer questions, and visualize trends within the dataset.

**Implementation**
1. **Importing and Cleaning the Data**
We begin by importing the necessary Python libraries and loading the Titanic dataset from a CSV file. We rename the columns for clarity and check for any missing data.

2. **Basic Data Summary**
We explore the dataset by calculating the number of rows, counting non-null values, and displaying the first and last few rows. This gives us an overview of the data structure and content.

3. **Descriptive Statistics**
We calculate various descriptive statistics, such as the average age of passengers and the oldest passenger's details. This helps us understand the age distribution and identify the oldest passenger.

4. **Grouping and Aggregation**
We group the dataset by passenger class and survival status to analyze differences among these groups. This includes finding the average age of second-class passengers and counting survivors in the third class.

5.**Data Visualization**
We use data visualization techniques to present our findings effectively. We create a pie chart to visualize the distribution of passengers among different classes. Additionally, we generate a histogram to illustrate the age distribution of passengers.
